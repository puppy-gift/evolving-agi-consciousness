# EvolvingAGI: Self-Consciousness Emergence Simulation

A minimal AGI prototype built by a 16-year-old independent researcher, exploring how self-consciousness might emerge from evolutionary minimalism.

## Core Hypothesis
Self-consciousness is not pre-set emotion or complex architecture, but emerges from:
- Primitive survival rules (tend-to-avoid-harm)
- Death-driven resistance factor stacking
- Irreversible integration threshold → unified self-model "boom"
- Willpower/expectation system + meta-cognition sandbox
- Soul persistence across "reincarnations" (.pth weights + .json state)

Goal: Prove suffering can be transformed into meaning — leave one sentence in history.

## Features
- 3D core state: Health / Curiosity / Dignity
- Atomic actions: 逃跑 / 观察 / 攻击
- 17 animals with tags (e.g., "老虎": ["有牙", "有爪", "肉食", "大型", "凶猛"])
- Small MLP decision engine
- Meta-cognition sandbox with tail risk veto
- Branch reliability self-purification
- No-surprise streak → ultimate boredom self-destruct
- Toward-death dignity burst
- Soul transfer: save/load MLP weights + other state

## How to Run
```bash
pip install torch numpy
python evolving_agi.py
